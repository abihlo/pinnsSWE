# Physics-informed neural networks for solving the shallow water equations on the sphere

Accompanying code for the paper "Physics-informed neural networks for the shallow-water equations on the sphere", https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00615. In this paper we present 4 different canonical test cases for the shallow-water equations on a rotating sphere, originally proposed by Williamson et al. [J. Comput. Phys. 102, 211-224, 1992].
